# Meme Central

A funny, meme storing desktop app built with electron, vue and typescript with AI assisted random caption generation from given tags.

I was learning to build desktop apps with electron so I thought I'd be a good starting point.

## Features

✔️ Generate new meme caption from tags using ChatGPT / OpenAI text model 😎

✔️ Check payament status and show annoying messages to friends 😂

✔️ Dark theme 🌙

✔️ Paste image from clipboard

✔️ Copy paste a file from explorer

✔️ Add tags to memes

✔️ Follows electronjs security guideliens

❌ Browse a file from explorer 🐸 meh

❌ Search memes by tags 🦥 too lazy to implement
